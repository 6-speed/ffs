future file system

not related to fsn specifically but somewhat inspired by the lack of anything better since then

this will be a file system for 3D globular data storage, with proper dynamic intelligent even-wear and safe-overwrite methodology

it will try to be an extension of FAT32 to the greatest extent possible, in the hope that it can be managed as a program as well as as a driver

each device will translate cylinders,heads,sectors or banks,chips,ranges into latitude-longitude-altitude for visual reference
