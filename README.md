future file system

not related to fsn specifically but somewhat inspired by the lack of anything better since then

this will be a file system for 3D data storage including mapping of weird address maps to a visual globe that allows proper even-wear and safe-overwrite methodology

it will try to be an extension of FAT32 to the greatest extent possible, in the hope that it can be managed as a program as well as as a driver

each device will translate cylinders,heads,sectors or banks,chips,ranges into latitude-longitude-altitude for visual reference
